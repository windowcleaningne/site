It looks like you're asking about cleaning windows in homes with pure water. This is a popular and effective method for achieving streak-free results. Here's a breakdown of how it works and why it's so popular:

How Pure Water Window Cleaning Works
Water Purification: The key to this method is using de-ionized (DI) or reverse osmosis (RO) water. Tap water contains dissolved minerals like calcium, magnesium, and iron. When tap water evaporates from a window, it leaves these minerals behind, which are the primary cause of streaks and water spots.

Specialized Equipment: Professional pure water systems typically involve a multi-stage filtration process. Water is pumped from a tank or directly from a tap through filters that remove all impurities.

Water-Fed Pole: The purified water is then pumped up a telescopic pole with a brush head on the end. The pole can extend to several stories high, eliminating the need for ladders in most cases.

Cleaning Process:

The brush head is used to agitate the dirt and grime on the window surface.

The pure water flowing through the brush then rinses all the dirt away.

Since the water is completely free of minerals, it dries naturally without leaving any residue, resulting in a perfectly clean, streak-free pane.

Advantages of Pure Water Window Cleaning
Streak-Free Finish: This is the biggest benefit. Because there are no minerals in the water, it dries clear and leaves no spots or streaks.

Eco-Friendly: This method often doesn't require any chemical detergents or cleaning solutions, making it a green alternative. The pure water itself is a powerful cleaning agent.

Increased Safety: The use of water-fed poles reduces or eliminates the need for ladders, which significantly lowers the risk of accidents for the window cleaner.

Reaches Difficult Areas: The long poles can easily access windows above conservatories, porches, or in hard-to-reach corners that would be difficult or dangerous to get to with a ladder.

Cleaner for Longer: Pure water cleaning leaves no soap residue behind. Soap can attract and hold onto new dirt particles, causing windows to get dirty faster. A pure water-cleaned window stays clean for a longer period.
