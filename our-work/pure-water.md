## Why We Don’t Use Tap or Bottled Water for Window Cleaning
Think of regular, standard tap water.

It has a taste which differs from home to home. The taste is due to the dissolved minerals and ions in the water. For tap water, that’s a great thing! But it’s not so good for windows…

Regular tap water has a taste — and it’s different from house to house. That’s because it contains dissolved minerals and ions, which is perfectly fine for drinking. In fact, bottled water contains even more minerals, because it’s collected “at source” — straight from underground springs, after trickling through layers of mineral-rich rock like limestone. This adds things like calcium, magnesium, and potassium.

##Great for drinking — not so great for your windows!
Purified water is simply water with all those impurities removed which makes it excellent for cleaning because the water will naturally attract the dirt and **drag it off the windows**.

Why We Don’t Use Buckets and Fairy Liquid

Picture the old-school window cleaner with his bucket of tap water and a splash of Fairy Liquid. When that water dries, what’s left behind? A film of dried minerals from the tap water — plus residue from the detergent. Over time, that build-up clings to your glass, hides around your frames, and gets trapped beneath the rubber seals. Not ideal!

Think of it like a carpet stain — sometimes it takes a few good scrubs to lift it, but once it’s gone, keeping it clean becomes much easier. Your windows are exactly the same.

That’s why we do it differently.

We use pure water technology, which means your windows and frames get a deep, residue-free clean. The pure water attracts and lifts the dirt, and when it dries, it leaves nothing behind — no streaks, no smears, just clean.

We’re proud to say we don’t just clean the panes — we clean the frames too. That first clean might occasionally cause a little spotting as trapped dirt is pulled out from hidden areas. It’s rare, but if it does happen, don’t worry — we offer a free re-clean guarantee for any spotting-related issues. Just give us a quick call and we’ll come straight back to fix it.
